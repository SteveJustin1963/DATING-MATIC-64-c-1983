# tec-DATING
a TEC-1 1960's style computer dating app

## Computer dating in the 1960s 
was a primitive version of modern online dating. It involved filling out questionnaires and waiting for a computer to process the answers and find matches. Despite its limitations, it was seen as a convenient way to find a compatible partner and became increasingly popular as technology and society evolved. Today, online dating platforms use sophisticated algorithms and matching systems to facilitate connections between people, but the basic concept of using computers to facilitate romantic connections has remained the same. Computer dating services were trying to establish themselves as credible and reputable matchmaking options, and they often emphasized the size and power of their computers as a way to build trust with potential customers. They also tried to present themselves as exclusive and selective in their matching process, implying that they only matched people with compatible personalities and backgrounds. These advertisements reflect the growing popularity of computer dating at the time, and the desire of these services to be seen as modern, sophisticated, and trustworthy. The computer dating services quickly evolved in the decades following their inception in the 1960s. The introduction of phones and photos allowed people to communicate and exchange more information about themselves, and the advent of the internet and early chat rooms in the 1980s provided even more opportunities for people to connect with potential partners. However, it seems that despite these advances, many of the same problems and challenges that people experienced with computer dating in the past still persist today. People can still misrepresent themselves in various ways, such as by lying about their age, weight, attractiveness, or height. Additionally, there are still instances of people behaving badly or making inappropriate requests while interacting with others online. These issues can be frustrating and can make the online dating experience less enjoyable for some people. However, despite these challenges, many people still find success and happiness through online dating.









## But I Digress
Lets pretend you are an alien in space and very lonely and you have drifted too far from your home plant and you have decided to find a new date on another planet. Its occurs to you to use the Drake equation to improve your extraterrestrial chances. The Drake equation is a tool used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that might exist in the Milky Way galaxy with which we might be able to communicate. It was developed by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s as a way to organize and quantify the factors that might influence the likelihood of the existence of such civilizations.

You the alien call up the the Drake dating program and the computer beeps back "It is inappropriate and disrespectful to use the Drake equation or extraterrestrial civilizations as a means of seeking a romantic partners. Such actions are not ethical and should be avoided." None the less you press override and this appears on your green screen.

Datekection: the search for a romantic partner among extraterrestrial civilizations:
```
N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

N = The number of dazzlingly beautiful female alien dates 
R* = The frequency of star formation across our dazzling galaxy 
fp = The proportion of stars that have their own planets 
ne = The typical number of planets suitable for female inhabitants per star 
fl = The portion of habitable worlds where female life is present 
fi = The fraction of fashion shops supporting sexy females 
fc = The part of female civilizations that use makeup and sexy clothing to broadcast their presence 
L = The length of time these females radiate their sexy existence

R*: 1
fp: 0.5
ne: 0.2
fl: 0.01
fi: 0.01
fc: 1
L: 3.8x10^9
```

Plugging in these values, and relative to his current star map location, the computer shows 
```
= 1 × 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.01 × 0.01 × 1 × 3.8 x 10^9 = 3.8 women 
and suggests "select blue marble with white swirls planet for best option and closest target"
```

The alien couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness at this very low opportunity. He always dreamed of travelling to other planets, and now, thanks to the Datekection app and his warp drive capable ship, he was about to make a journey to Earth to meet his dream date. With a deep breath, the alien hit the warp 9 thrust button, and the spaceship shot forward at an incredible speed. The stars outside the window seemed to blur together as they accelerated through the vast expanse of space, heading towards the destination. As he drew closer to Earth, the alien marvelled at the beauty of the blue and green planet, hanging suspended in the blackness of space. He pressed the scan button to survey for sexy female lifeforms, he hoped for just 3 per the Datekection analysis. One minute later the results came back, 3,904,727,342. Five minutes later he landed the spaceship. He rub the cockpit window clear from his heavy breathing and not familiar with the writing on the adjacent build he slowly deciphered the letters SETI. He thought it had something to do with dating, like Sexy Extraterrestrial Intelligence, so he rushed out and just then the intergalactic space police slapped cuffs on him for violating the inappropriate and disrespectful use of the Drake equation. The staff inside the SETI building threw another party as their honey trap for aliens worked again. By the way SETI stands for Seduction of of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, the real SETI is over a block away.
