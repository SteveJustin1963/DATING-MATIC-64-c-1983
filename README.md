a TEC-1 1960's style computer dating app

## But I Digress
Lets pretend you are an alien in space and very lonely and you have drifted too far from your home plant and you have decided to find a new date on another planet. Its occurs to you to use the Drake equation to improve your extraterrestrial chances. The Drake equation is a tool used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that might exist in the Milky Way galaxy with which we might be able to communicate. It was developed by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s as a way to organize and quantify the factors that might influence the likelihood of the existence of such civilizations.

You the alien call up the the Drake dating program and the computer beeps back "It is inappropriate and disrespectful to use the Drake equation or extraterrestrial civilizations as a means of seeking a romantic partners. Such actions are not ethical and should be avoided." None the less you press override and this appears on your green screen.

Datekection: the search for a romantic partner among extraterrestrial civilizations:
```
N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

N = The number of dazzlingly beautiful female alien dates 
R* = The frequency of star formation across our dazzling galaxy 
fp = The proportion of stars that have their own planets 
ne = The typical number of planets suitable for female inhabitants per star 
fl = The portion of habitable worlds where female life is present 
fi = The fraction of fashion shops supporting sexy females 
fc = The part of female civilizations that use makeup and sexy clothing to broadcast their presence 
L = The length of time these females radiate their sexy existence

R*: 1
fp: 0.5
ne: 0.2
fl: 0.01
fi: 0.01
fc: 1
L: 3.8x10^9
```

Plugging in these values, and relative to his current star map location, the computer shows 
```
= 1 × 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.01 × 0.01 × 1 × 3.8 x 10^9 = 3.8 women 
and suggests "select blue marble with white swirls planet for best option and closest target"
```

The alien couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness at this very low opportunity. He always dreamed of travelling to other planets, and now, thanks to the Datekection app and his warp drive capable ship, he was about to make a journey to Earth to meet his dream date. With a deep breath, the alien hit the warp 9 thrust button, and the spaceship shot forward at an incredible speed. The stars outside the window seemed to blur together as they accelerated through the vast expanse of space, heading towards the destination. As he drew closer to Earth, the alien marvelled at the beauty of the blue and green planet, hanging suspended in the blackness of space. He pressed the scan button to survey for sexy female lifeforms, he hoped for just 3 per the Datekection analysis. One minute later the results came back, 3,904,727,342. Five minutes later he landed the spaceship. He rub the cockpit window clear from his heavy breathing and not familiar with the writing on the adjacent build he slowly deciphered the letters SETI. He thought it had something to do with dating, like Sexy Extraterrestrial Intelligence, so he rushed out and just then the intergalactic space police slapped cuffs on him for violating the inappropriate and disrespectful use of the Drake equation. The staff inside the SETI building threw another party as their honey trap for aliens worked again. By the way SETI stands for Seduction of of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, the real SETI is over a block away.
