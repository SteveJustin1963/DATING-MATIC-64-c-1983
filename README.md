## code
This program prompts the user to enter two names by reading them from a paper tape reader, and then asks ten questions to determine compatibility. The COMPATIBILITY function asks each question and increments the compatibility score if the answers match. The program then displays the compatibility score or "Perfect match!" on the six-segment display using port 3.
